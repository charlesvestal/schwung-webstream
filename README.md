# Webstream Module (Move Everything)

Experimental v2 sound-generator module for web audio playback via provider backends.

Third-party, unsupported community module. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Ableton or YouTube.

## Current Behavior

- Exports a **v2 DSP plugin** (`move_plugin_init_v2`)
- Uses menu UI with:
  - `[New Search...]` (provider picker first)
  - `[Previous searches]`
  - search results list
- Starts streaming when a result is selected
- Uses a warm `yt-dlp` daemon for search/URL resolve, then `ffmpeg` decode to 44.1kHz stereo `s16le`
- Supports transport controls (play/pause, seek ±15s, stop, restart) via mapped knobs
- Current providers:
  - `youtube` (via `yt-dlp`)
  - `soundcloud` (via `yt-dlp`)
  - `archive` (via archive.org APIs)
  - `freesound` (via FreeSound API; requires token)

## Provider Configuration

Runtime provider config path:

- `/data/UserData/move-anything/config/webstream_providers.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "freesound": {
      "enabled": true,
      "api_key": "YOUR_FREESOUND_TOKEN"
    },
    "archive": { "enabled": true },
    "youtube": { "enabled": true },
    "soundcloud": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

FreeSound token can also be supplied via env var:

- `FREESOUND_API_KEY` (or `FREESOUND_TOKEN`)

## Build

```bash
./scripts/build-deps.sh   # optional but recommended: bundle yt-dlp/deno/ffmpeg
./scripts/build.sh
```

Release assets (both variants):

```bash
./scripts/build-deps.sh
./scripts/build-release-assets.sh
```

- `dist/webstream-module.tar.gz` bundles runtime dependencies.
- `dist/webstream-module-core.tar.gz` is core-only (user supplies `yt-dlp`/`deno`/`ffmpeg`).

## Install

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Dependency Build Documentation

See `BUILDING.md` for detailed, reproducible steps for `yt-dlp`, `deno`, and `ffmpeg`.
